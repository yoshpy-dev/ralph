# harness-engineering-scaffolding-template

A language-agnostic scaffold for practicing harness engineering with **Claude Code first** and **cross-vendor portability second**.

This repository is intentionally designed as a **map, not a manual**:
- `AGENTS.md` is the vendor-neutral map for any coding agent.
- `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` and adds Claude Code specific guidance.
- `.claude/rules/` keeps conditional guidance out of the always-on context.
- `.claude/skills/` provides on-demand workflows for plan, work, self-review, verify, and harness auditing.
- `.claude/hooks/` adds deterministic runtime guardrails where instructions alone are not enough.
- `packs/languages/` provides opt-in language specializations without hard-coding the core scaffold to one stack.

## Why this scaffold exists

Strong harnesses are not just prompts. They combine:
1. **A small always-on map**
2. **On-demand workflows**
3. **Deterministic checks on the execution path**
4. **Evidence-backed review and verification**
5. **Optional escalation to subagents, worktrees, or agent teams when the task truly needs them**

The default philosophy here is:

- Start simple
- Add complexity only when the model or task demands it
- Keep plans, decisions, tech debt, and evidence in the repo
- Promote recurring mistakes from prose into scripts, rules, tests, hooks, or CI

## Quick start

1. Initialize the project (cleans template artifacts, bootstraps hooks and directories).

   ```sh
   ./scripts/init-project.sh
   ```

2. Edit these files first:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `CLAUDE.md`
   - `.claude/rules/*.md`
   - `packs/languages/*/verify.sh` or `scripts/verify.local.sh`

3. Create your first plan.

   ```sh
   # Standard flow
   ./scripts/new-feature-plan.sh login-form

   # Ralph Loop (directory-based plan with parallel slices)
   ./scripts/new-ralph-plan.sh login-form N/A 3
   ```

4. In Claude Code, follow the loop:
   - `/spec` (optional) → `/plan` → `/work` (or `/loop`) → `/self-review` → `/verify` → `/test` → `/codex-review` (optional) → `/pr`

5. Before claiming a task is done, run:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/run-verify.sh
   ```

## Operating loop

This scaffold assumes the following default loop. `/spec` is the only manual trigger; all other steps are auto-invoked.

1. **Explore**
   - Read relevant code, docs, rules, and open plans
   - Decide whether the task is small enough to stay single-session

1.5. **Spec** (manual, optional — `/spec`)
   - Use when the request is too vague for `/plan`
   - Explores the codebase, researches best practices, and clarifies requirements interactively
   - Produces a spec file in `docs/specs/` and optionally creates a GitHub issue
   - Can hand off directly to `/plan` after completion

2. **Plan** (auto — `/plan`)
   - Create or refresh a file-backed plan in `docs/plans/active/`
   - Define acceptance criteria, contracts, risks, and verification
   - Optionally link a GitHub issue for context pre-fill
   - Select execution flow: standard (`/work`) or Ralph Loop (`/loop`)

3. **Work** (auto — `/work`) or **Loop** (auto — `/loop`)
   - `/work`: creates a branch (`git checkout -b`) and implements interactively in Claude Code
   - `/loop`: creates a Git Worktree and sets up autonomous iteration via `claude -p`

4. **Self-review** (auto — `/self-review`)
   - Produce a written review artifact (diff quality only)
   - Prefer read-only reviewer agents for audit tasks

5. **Verify** (auto — `/verify`)
   - Check spec compliance against acceptance criteria
   - Run static analysis and documentation drift checks
   - Record results in `docs/reports/`

6. **Test** (auto — `/test`)
   - Run behavioral tests (unit, integration, regression)
   - Tests must pass before PR creation

7. **Codex review** (auto, optional — `/codex-review`)
   - Cross-model second opinion on the diff using Codex CLI
   - Silently skipped if Codex is unavailable
   - Findings are advisory — user decides whether to act

8. **PR** (auto — `/pr`)
   - Create a pull request with structured summary
   - Archive finished plans from `active/` to `archive/`
   - Include walkthrough for large diffs

9. **CI + Human merge**
   - `verify.yml` runs `run-verify.sh` on the PR
   - Human reviews and merges

## Hook configuration

`.claude/settings.json` ships with all hooks pre-configured:

- Session start context
- Prompt-level reminders
- Bash guardrails
- Edit/write verification reminders
- Tool failure feedback
- Compaction checkpoints
- Session end summary

Customize by editing `.claude/settings.json` directly. Use `.claude/settings.local.json` for personal overrides (gitignored).

## Language packs

The core scaffold stays stack-agnostic. Language-specific depth lives in `packs/languages/`.

Included starter packs:
- `typescript/`
- `python/`
- `rust/`
- `golang/`
- `dart/` (Flutter support included)
- `_template/` for new packs

Add a new pack with:

```sh
./scripts/new-language-pack.sh go
```

Then wire it into:
- `packs/languages/<name>/verify.sh`
- `.claude/rules/<name>.md`
- project build/test/tooling

## Ralph Loop (autonomous parallel execution)

For large tasks that can be split into independent slices, the Ralph Loop runs parallel pipelines across multiple Git worktrees. Each slice gets its own `claude -p` pipeline that handles the full lifecycle autonomously (implement → self-review → verify → test → sync-docs → codex-review). Completed slices are sequentially merged into an integration branch, and a unified PR is created.

```sh
# Create a directory-based plan with slices
./scripts/new-ralph-plan.sh my-feature N/A 3

# Run the orchestrator
./scripts/ralph run --plan docs/plans/active/2026-01-01-my-feature/ --unified-pr

# Check progress
./scripts/ralph status

# Safely stop
./scripts/ralph abort
```

Or use the `/loop` skill inside Claude Code for interactive setup.

Safety rails include iteration limits, stuck detection (3 consecutive no-change iterations), Inner/Outer Loop architecture with repair attempt caps, and hook parity checks.

See `docs/recipes/ralph-loop.md` for the full guide.

## Portability model

This scaffold deliberately separates:
- **Portable instruction map**: `AGENTS.md`
- **Claude-native control plane**: `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/agents/`
- **Language packs**: `packs/languages/`
- **Deterministic scripts and CI**: `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`

That gives you a base you can keep if you later add Codex, Gemini CLI, or another coding agent.

## Recommended adoption order

See `docs/roadmap/harness-maturity-model.md`, but the short version is:

1. Map + verify
2. Plan/work/self-review/verify skills
3. Deterministic hooks
4. Path-scoped rules and subagents
5. Worktrees and agent teams for genuinely parallel tasks
6. Evaluator loops and richer observability only when the task complexity earns the cost

## Important defaults

- Keep `AGENTS.md` short
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` shorter
- Move topic-specific guidance to `.claude/rules/`
- Move workflow-specific guidance to `.claude/skills/`
- Prefer evidence over confidence
- Do not rely on prose for hard guarantees
- Treat human attention as the scarcest resource in the system

## Useful files to inspect first

- `docs/research/approach-comparison.md`
- `docs/architecture/design-principles.md`
- `.claude/skills/plan/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/hooks/pre_bash_guard.sh`
- `scripts/run-verify.sh`
- `docs/roadmap/harness-maturity-model.md`
